### The App that will save your skin from mosquito bites

An Android citizen science app to record and map encounters with mosquitoes

**Do you want to help science?**
Mosquito Mapper is the first of a list of Citizen Science tools made to help scientists answer big questions and to help you, citizens of the world, avoiding theses annoying mosquitoes.

### How does it work?

It all relies on you. When using the app, you inform us of the presence of mosquitoes in your area. Not only that, but you will also provide us with data about your surroundings that will help us predict the behaviour of mosquitoes. You will also have the possibility to identify anatomical characteristics of the mosquito and send us a picture for further analysis.

### What we do with the data?

When we pool all the data you provide, we can create a real-time map of mosquito presence. For us scientists, these data help us understand the structure of mosquito populations and then we can try to predict where mosquitoes may appear so that we can prevent them from reaching you.

### This is important!
Mosquitoes are a primary vector of life-threatening diseases. Warning people about the probability of being bitten could save lives. Help us and help yourself by using our app!
In this alpha release, you will be able to locate, identify and send us pictures of your encounters with mosquitoes. The data you sent will be used for scientific purposes, by downloading and using the app, you agree to let us use these data.

*Permissions: We are only asking a few things from you, your position and the access to your camera. All the permissions the app demands are related to these two tools.*
